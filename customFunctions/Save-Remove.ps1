function global:Save-Remove {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Safely removes files or directories

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function prevents accidental deletion by:
          - Prompting the user for confirmation before removing
          - Moving the specified file or directory to a trash folder
          - Appending a timestamp to the moved item to track deletion time
          - Creating the trash folder if it does not exist

    .PARAMETER TargetPaths
        One or more file or directory paths

    .PARAMETER TrashDirectory
        The directory where deleted items are stored

    .EXAMPLE
        Save-Remove .\myfile.txt

    .EXAMPLE
        Save-Remove .\file1.txt .\folder1 -TrashDirectory "D:\mytrash"

    .EXAMPLE
        # with function alias
        delete .\file1.txt .\folder1
        delete .\file1.txt .\folder1 -TrashDirectory "D:\mytrash"

    .NOTES
        - Works for both files and directories (including nested contents)
        - Does not permanently delete; recovery is possible from the trash directory
